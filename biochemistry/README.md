## 1. Genomics
¶ The <b>genome,</b> is the complete set of genetic material, mainly composed of genes and gene-like nucleic acids sequences and the study of the genomes is called <b>genomics</b>.

Now, every atom and molecule associated with some type of energy. And, nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) also have many atoms and their bonds formations with possibilities, finally the Energy of the molecule.

So, the genome itself associated with an Energy, <b>E</b>.

<b>Syntax:</b>

   <b>E<sub>genome</sub></b> = Energy of the genome.

<b>Units:</b>

   <b><i>k</i>/mol</b>
       
If we're doing Quantum treatment of Genome itself associated with an Energy, <b>Eψ</b>.

<b>Syntax:</b>

   <b>Eψ<sub>genome</sub></b> = Energy of the genome.
 
 <b>Units:</b>

   <b><i>k</i>/mol</b>
