## 1. Genomics
¶ The <b>genome,</b> is the complete set of genetic material, mainly composed of genes and gene-like nucleic acids sequences and the study of the genomes is called <b>genomics</b>.

Now, every atom and molecule associated with some type of energy. And, nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) also have many atoms and their bonds formations with possibilities, finally the Energy of the molecule.

So, the genome itself associated with an Energy, <b>E</b>.

<b>Syntax:</b>

   <b>E<sub>genome</sub></b> = Energy of the genome.

<b>Units:</b>

   <b><i>k</i>/mol</b>
       
If we're doing Quantum treatment of Genome itself associated with an Energy, <b>Eψ</b>.

<b>Syntax:</b>

   <b>Eψ<sub>genome</sub></b> = Energy of the genome.
 
 <b>Units:</b>

   <b><i>k</i>/mol</b>
  
## Corollary
Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger; 12 August 1887 – 4 January 1961), sometimes written as Erwin Schrodinger or Erwin Schroedinger, was a Nobel Prize-winning Austrian physicist who developed a number of fundamental results in the field of quantum theory, which formed the basis of wave mechanics: he formulated the wave equation (stationary and time-dependent Schrödinger equation) and revealed the identity of his development of the formalism and matrix mechanics. Schrödinger proposed an original interpretation of the physical meaning of the wave function.

¶ <b>Lemma<sub>(gene)</sub>:</b>

Genes are associated with perturbations (a disturbance of motion, course, arrangement, or state of equilibrium), and multi-electron system of molecular design governing it's energy to work and finally at genome level of arrangement of Energy.

## 2. Quantum Genomics
¶ The <b>Quantum Genomics</b>, is a fundamental theoretical science which explains loudly the nature of genes, itself associated system and sub-system and their expression behavior at the small scales and energy levels of atoms and their bonding possibilities. Quantum genomics is a great way to understand the mathematical equations written inside the combination of genes and finally genome. There is no way till this date, it's understood by any other methods.

So, it's a formulation of mathematical models and equations to understand deeply, how whole genome is behaving <i>in-vivo</i>.
