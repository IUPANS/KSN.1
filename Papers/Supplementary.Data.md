<b>1.</b> Ubiquitin is one of the most conserved proteins known in eukaryotic organisms. Ubiquitin is required for ATP-dependent, non-lysosomal intracellular protein degradation of abnormal proteins and normal proteins with a rapid turnover. Ubiquitin is covalently bound to proteins to be degraded, and presumably labels these proteins for degradation. Ubiquitin is a small (8.5 kDa) regulatory protein found in most tissues of eukaryotic organisms i.e. it occurs ubiquitously. It was discovered in 1975<sup>[1]</sup> in Israel by Gideon Goldstein and further characterized throughout the 1970s and 1980s.<sup>[2]</sup> Four genes in the human genome code for ubiquitin: UBB, UBC, UBA52 and RPS27A.<sup>[3]</sup>

  - Ubiquitin is a protein that in humans is encoded by the UBB gene.<sup>[3]</sup>
  - Polyubiquitin-C is a protein encoded by the UBC gene in humans.<sup>[5][6][7]</sup>
  - 60S ribosomal protein L40 (RPL40) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the UBA52 gene.<sup>[4][5]</sup>
  - 40S ribosomal protein S27a is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RPS27A gene.<sup>[5][6]</sup>
